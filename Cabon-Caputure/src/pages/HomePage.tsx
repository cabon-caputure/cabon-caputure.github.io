                This is about seaweed that saves the atmosphere. By planting seaweed we take in CO2. 
                As you probably know there is too much CO2 in the atmosphere and we are at fault. 
                To fix this we must take out a lot of CO2. This method was created by a group called Seafields. 
                Though this hasn't been used at scale it is extremely powerful. It can take 107 tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere 
                per year, per every hectare. The idea is to cover 0.02% of the earth or about the size of portugal. 
                By cultivating Sargassum seaweed it starts taking in CO2 which then can be stored for long periods of time. 
                After we start planting seaweed and letting it grow we can start to see results. It could take a couple years for a good amount 
                of seaweed to grow. The is a very useful method as it is passive. Instead of having to use massive factories and plants 
                we can just let the seaweed grow. Though it is very useful there is a flaw with this. 
                It might take too long for the seaweed to grow which means that the temperature could be too 
                high meaning that the seaweed can't grow.
